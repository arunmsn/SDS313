# Part 1
""" 1. Create a subset that contains all of the bonds from Travis County.  
Parse the election date variable and ensure that it was converted to a date variable correctly.  
Investigate any dates that donâ€™t make sense and either fix them or remove them from the dataset.  
Briefly describe what you did in your report and provide the final number of bonds in your 
Travis County subset (use this subset for #2 and #3 below).

2. What month had the most bond election dates? Which day of the week had the most election dates? 

3. Make a graph that compares the percentages of bonds that were carried across months and another 
graph to compare the percentages that were carried across days of the week. Briefly summarize what 
your graphs show in a few sentences.
