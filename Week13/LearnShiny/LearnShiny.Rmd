```{r}
# Shiny apps are contained in a single script called app.R. 
# The script app.R lives in a directory (for example, newdir/) 
#   and the app can be run with runApp("newdir").
# app.R has 3 components:
#   a UI                    - controls layout and appearance of app
#   a server                - contains the instructions the computer needs to build the app
#   and a call to shinyApp  - creates the ShinyApp objects from an explicit UI/server pair
```

```{r}
# Below is the basic format for a Shiny App
library(shiny)

user_int <- ...
serv <- ...
shinyApp(ui = user_int, server = serv)
# any App.R file must end with a call to shinyApp
# if a Shiny App is in a directory called "my_app", then the following would be done:
runApp("my_app")
```

```{r}
runApp("App-1", display.mode = "showcase")
runApp("App-1.1", display.mode = "showcase")
