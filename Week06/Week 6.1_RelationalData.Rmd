In this worksheet, we will:

-   Identify key variables and how they are used to join datasets
-   Perform different types of joins to combine datasets in various ways
-   Address common issues in joining datasets

## 0. Datasets and Library

We will discuss joining functions to combine datasets from the `tidyverse` package:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Load a package
library(tidyverse)
```

Consider the following built-in datasets containing information about some band members of the Beatles and Rolling Stones:

```{r}
# Preview datasets
band_members
band_instruments
```

To join datasets, we first need to identify a **key variable** (a variable, or sometimes a set of variables, that defines a unique row in a dataset). What is the key variable to join the two datasets above?

**Write sentences here.**

## 1. Different types of joining functions

### a. Inner join

Join datasets using `inner_join()` to get the information they have in common:

```{r}
# Join 2 datasets with `inner_join()`
inner_join(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")
```

Why we only get 2 rows?

**Write sentences here.**  
Keeps only what is common between both datasets.  

### b. Left join

Join datasets using `left_join()` to keep information from the "left" dataset and add information from the "right" dataset:

```{r}
# Join 2 datasets with `left_join()` 
left_join(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")
```

There was one row in the left dataset that did not appear in the right dataset. How did R handle that?

**Write sentences here.**  
It put in an NA value.  

#### **Try it! Swap the left and right datasets from above. How do the resulting joined dataset compare?**

```{r}
# Write and submit code here!
left_join(band_instruments, band_members, by = "name")
```

**Write sentences here.**  
This time, Mick is not present but Keith is. Since Keith is not in a band but plays guitar, his row has an NA for band.  

### c. Right join

This function does the opposite of `left_join()` so it is not widely used.

```{r}
# Join 2 datasets with `right_join()`
right_join(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")
```

Which `left_join()` function above gave a similar result?

**Write sentences here.**  
The left_join with band_instruments comparing to band_members (the second one).  

### d. Full join

Join datasets using `full_join()` to keep information from both datasets:

```{r}
# Join 2 datasets with `full_join()`
full_join(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")
```

Note how R added missing values for the names that were in only one of these two datasets.

### e. Anti join

We can use `anti_join()` to get information from the left dataset for which there is no information in the right dataset:

```{r}
# Find missing observations with `anti_join()`
anti_join(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")
```

Mick did not have an instrument in `band_instruments`.

## 2. Common issues with joining

There are some options and common issues to consider when joining different datasets.

### a. No matching key

Some datasets may refer to the same variable with different names. Consider the following datasets:

```{r}
band_members
band_instruments2
```

What happens if we are joining 2 datasets that have different names for the key variable?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Join the two datasets with different key variables
left_join(band_members, band_instruments2, by = "name")
```

We need to specify the name of the key in each dataset:

```{r}
# Join the two datasets with different key variables
left_join(band_members, band_instruments2,
          # and specify which variables match across datasets with `c()`
          by = c("name" = "artist"))
```

*Note: The order in which we specify the match for the key variable matters: specify the match from the left dataset to the right dataset. Also, note that only the first name of the key variable is kept in the joined dataset.*

### b. Auto-suffixing

Here is another dataset reporting fun facts about instruments:

```{r}
# Consider this new dataset
band_instruments3 <- data.frame(
  name = c("John","Paul","Keith"),
  plays = c("a Steinway upright piano his biggest solo hit Imagine ", 
            "54 different instruments", 
            "10 out of his 3,000 guitars regularly"))
band_instruments3
```

What happens if we are joining 2 datasets with the same variable name that is *not a key* variable?

```{r}
# Join the two variables of instruments played
left_join(band_instruments, band_instruments3, by = "name")
```

Any columns that have the same name in both datasets but are not used to join on will be given suffixes `.x` and `.y` to specify which original dataset they came from (left and right, respectively). You can modify the default suffix:

```{r}
# Join the two variables of instruments played
left_join(band_instruments, band_instruments3, by = "name",
          # To give names to the suffix, use `suffix =`
          suffix = c(".instrument",".fun_fact"))
```

*Note: If the same variable appears in both dataset with the same meaning, it might be a key variable! See section d. below.*

### c. Duplicates

Here is another dataset reporting a member of a new band:

```{r}
# Consider this new dataset
band_members2 <- data.frame(
  name = c("Mick","John","Paul","John"),
  band = c("Stones", "Beatles", "Beatles", "Bluesbreakers"))
band_members2
```

#### **Try it! Join all the information from `band_members2` to the instruments they play. Is the information contained in the resulting dataset correct?**

```{r}
# Write and submit code here!
left_join(band_members2, band_instruments, by = "name")
```

**Write sentences here.** 
No! The John from the Bluesbreakers is assumed here to play guitar due to the John from the Beatles playing guitar. This is incorrect.  

*Note that it is sometimes useful to add repeating information for some rows that share the same key. We just need to be careful that it makes sense!*

### d. Several key variables

Sometimes one variable is not enough to identify a unique match. Consider this new dataset:

```{r}
# Add a variable to instruments
band_instruments4 <- band_instruments |> 
  mutate(band = c("Beatles", "Beatles", "Stones"))
band_instruments4
```

What key variable(s) should be taken into account to identify a unique row when matching this data with `band_members2`?

```{r}
# Join 2 datasets with 2 key variables
left_join(band_members2, band_instruments4, 
          # List the key variables with `c()`
          by = c("name", "band"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Group Practice

You will join information from the `flights` and `weather` datasets from the *nycflights* package:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
flights <- flights
weather <- weather
```

We can see how these tables relate to each other: ![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/245292d1ea724f6c3fd8a92063dcd7bfb9758d02/5751b/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)

Within your group, you will explore if the weather impacts whether or not a flight was delayed. To do so:

1.  In `flights`, create a variable called `delay_60minutes` that takes values `TRUE` if the departure delay was greater than or equal to 60 minutes and `FALSE` if the delay was less than 60 minutes (but still greater than 0).
2.  Join the information from the `weather`, if available.
3.  Choose one of the variables from the weather dataset and check if there is difference between the flights that were delayed more than 60 minutes or not with a plot and summary statistics.

Share your plot, statistics, and conclusion [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-0vXn7aHlU9SZARjkIfGrCRqxk48VTVMU_8nqsbYtjI/edit?usp=sharing).

4.  Were there any flights that did not have any weather information?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
```{r warning = FALSE}
# Question 1
flights2 <- flights |>
  mutate(delayed_60minutes = case_when(
    dep_delay >= 60 ~ TRUE,
    dep_delay > 0 ~ FALSE,
    dep_delay < 0 ~ NA
  ))
flights2

# Question 2
full <- full_join(weather, flights2)
full <- full |>
  filter(log(wind_speed) < 5) 

# Question 3
ggplot(full) + geom_boxplot(aes(y = log(wind_speed))) + labs(
  title = "Wind speed vs. Departure Delay by 60+ Minutes",
  y = "log(Wind Speed)"
) + facet_wrap(~delayed_60minutes) + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

# Question 4
anti_join(flights, weather, by = c("time_hour", "origin"))
```
